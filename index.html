	<li>Cut a medium sized square of aluminum foil and lay flat.  Lay taro leaves so that they create a surface large enough to add more ingredients on.  Place a spoonful or two of corned beef on taro leaves.  Sprinkle a spoonful of chopped onions on corned beef.  Pour a spoonful or two of coconut milk on previous ingredients.  Fold corners of aluminum foil up over ingredients and twist so that the contents are sealed without chance of leaking.  </li>
